# AGENTS Folder - Documentation Guide

Minimal index and reading guide for AI assistants working on this project.

## Required Startup Reading

Read in this order:
1. `AI_RULES_CHATGPT.md` or `AI_RULES_CLAUDE.md` (entry point, one only).
2. `AGENTS_README.md` (this file).
3. `PROJECT.md`.
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
5. `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
6. `AI_BEHAVIOR.md`.
7. `ISSUES_TODO.md`.

Optional on demand:
- `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` for closed issues and solution history.
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` only when a commit/branch/PR action is requested.

## File Map

### Core docs
- `PROJECT.md`: project scope, features, references.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: structure, key paths, commands.
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: coding rules for PHP/WordPress/HTML/CSS/JS.
- `AI_BEHAVIOR.md`: operational behavior, issue management, documentation workflow.

### Issue docs
- `ISSUES_TODO.md`: open issues, grouped by category and priority.
- `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md`: resolved issues archive.

### Agent entry points
- `AI_RULES_CHATGPT.md`: ChatGPT/Codex startup instructions.
- `AI_RULES_CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code startup instructions.

### VCS workflow
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`: branch/commit/PR rules used only when VCS tasks are requested.

## Issue Categories (ISSUES_TODO.md)

`Security`, `Bug`, `Refactoring`, `CodeStyle`, `Performance`, `Accessibility`, `Feature`, `Documentation`.

## Notes

- Keep AGENTS docs concise and project-specific.
- Remove obsolete rules quickly.
- Avoid repeating the same rule across multiple AGENTS files when one canonical location is enough.
