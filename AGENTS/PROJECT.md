## Project Overview

Design laboratori e centri di ricerca is a WordPress theme developed by the Scuola Normale Superiore with the aim of creating a website model for research structures (centers and laboratories).

Once installed, the environment provides a set of predefined contents that make the setup of the website simple and fast.

This website allows the publication of all information related to a research structure: affiliated staff organized by structure, publications, research projects, research activities (aggregation of projects), as well as news and events related to the activities.

The project aims to highlight and enhance the activities and research staff of the structures.

It is possible to easily test the system locally by using the Dockerfile provided in the project source code or by using the demo site: https://sitofederato.sns.it.
