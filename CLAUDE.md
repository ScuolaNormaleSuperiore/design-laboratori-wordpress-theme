# CLAUDE.md

Read the file `AGENTS/AI_RULES_CLAUDE.md` automatically and follow all instructions of the section "Session bootstrap" of that file to build the context of the session.

Run the "Session bootstrap" instructions only once at session start.
Do not re-run bootstrap on every interaction.
Re-run bootstrap only when the user explicitly requests it (for example: "reload agents", "re-read AGENTS", or equivalent).
